* PARADE is organized by Tadashi Yonago and Kayu Nakada living in Osaka. It is an event in the open air for sounds since Aug 2017, that held on an irregular base. Artists play at a spot they choose, such of a road side of downtown, residential area, parks, riverside... And we can listen the performance fused with the situation/atmosphere of the place.
